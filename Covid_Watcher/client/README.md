# client


## Project Structure

The entirety of the web application exists in two folders (not counting database creation and data-mining). In the client folder is the front-end which consists of our components, views, routes and store modules. In the server folder is the backend which only consists of our database queries, some data manipulation and routes to those queries.


## Project setup
```
Assuming this is for a MacOS, one should be able to download both the client and server folder and deploy them in development servers via the commands "npm run serve" and "npm start" in the client and server folders respectively. From there, the website will most likely be hosted on localhost:8080 and the backend should be hosted at localhost:8081.
