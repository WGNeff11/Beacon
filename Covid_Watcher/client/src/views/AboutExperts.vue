            <p> With respect to the corona-virus, there are lots of experts with specialized knowledge in various elements of the disease. When deciding who to pick as our “Covid-19 Experts” we hinged on choosing voices with varied expertise in public health, health care preparedness and epidemiology, but also voices in positions of power that could carefully disseminate information to their constituents. This includes state and federal government officials, presidential candidates and le-ders of large businesses. These experts provide information on local quarantine guidelines, how to seek medical help among other pieces of invaluable streamlined information in hopes of quelling the virus.</p>
